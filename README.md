# Scraps-Rebuilt-Games-Jam-
This was a game I developed with a team of five when participating in a games jam. This game was built in unity in one weekend and includes models/animations made during the games jam in blender.


Individual contributions:

Model rigging/animating in Blender
Importing blender models into Unity
Unity environment design
Obstacle design/gameplay design
